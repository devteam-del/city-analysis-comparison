"""Shared configuration for the 市民大道一段 activity-heatmap pipeline.

IMPORTANT: this project does NOT have access to real telecom/mobile-signaling
population-flow data (that data is proprietary to carriers and not published
as open data). Everything here is built from Taipei City open data (MRT
hourly ridership, YouBike station activity) used as a PROXY for pedestrian
activity, not a direct measurement of population flow. See ../data_sources.md
for full citations and caveats.
