"""Fetch Taipei MRT hourly station entry/exit counts from data.taipei and
filter down to stations within 2km of 市民大道一段.

Dataset: 臺北捷運各站分時進出量統計OD (Taipei MRT hourly station
entry/exit volume by O-D), published on data.taipei:
  https://data.taipei/dataset/detail?id=63f31c7e-7fc3-418b-bd82-b95158755b4d

NOTE ON VERIFICATION: this script was written from a sandboxed environment
whose network egress policy blocks data.taipei outright (confirmed via a
direct connection test: `CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403`), so the
exact resource id and JSON column names below could NOT be confirmed
end-to-end from here. Before relying on this script:
  1. Open the dataset page above in a normal browser.
  2. Click its "API" tab to get the current resource id ("rid") and a
     sample response -- data.taipei's dataset UUID (in the page URL) and
     the resource id used by the API are not always the same value.
  3. Update RESOURCE_ID and COLUMN_MAP below to match what you see.

Run: python fetch_mrt_hourly.py
Output: ../data/mrt_hourly.csv with columns [station, hour, entries, exits]
        summed across whatever date range the API call returns, for the
        stations returned by stations_in_radius().
